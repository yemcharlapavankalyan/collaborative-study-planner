Collaborative Study Planner – Java OOP Project:

This project is a console-based Study Planner application developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
The main goal of the project is to help students plan their study activities, create groups, assign tasks, schedule study sessions, and track progress in an organized manner.

## Features

- Create users and study groups  
- Add tasks with dependencies  
- Detect circular dependencies  
- Schedule study sessions using `LocalDateTime`  
- Check for conflicts between sessions  
- Track task progress and revision logs  
- View basic analytics like completed tasks and activity summary  
- Save and load data using CSV files
- 
CSV Storage

The project stores data in CSV files so that the information is not lost after closing the program.
Examples:

users.csv  
tasks.csv  
sessions.csv  
logs.csv


Sample Outputs

Task added successfully.
Circular dependency detected.
Study session scheduled.
Conflict detected with an existing session.
Progress updated.

Learning Outcomes
	•	Practical understanding of Java OOP concepts
	•	Working with packages and modular code
	•	File handling using CSV
	•	Handling dependencies, conflicts, and scheduling logic
	•	Improved problem-solving and debugging skills
